# Live Location Duration Fix Summary

## Problem
The bot was continuing to send facts beyond the specified live location duration. For example, if a user requested 1 hour of live location tracking, the bot would continue sending facts even after 2+ hours, using the last known location.

## Root Causes
1. **No proper session expiration check**: The bot relied on checking if location updates were still coming, but Telegram stops sending updates when live sharing ends, so the bot never detected the expiration.
2. **No handler for live location stop signal**: When a user manually stops live location sharing, Telegram sends a regular location message (without `live_period`). The bot wasn't detecting this as a stop signal.
3. **Session duration not tracked from start**: The bot was checking time since last update rather than time since session start.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Session Start Time Tracking
- Added `session_start` field to `LiveLocationData` to track when the session began
- Session now expires based on `session_start + live_period` rather than relying on update timestamps

### 2. Implemented Proper Session Expiration
- The `_fact_sending_loop` now checks if current time >= session end time before sending each fact
- When session expires, sends a notification to the user and cleanly exits the loop
- Added localized expiration messages in Russian, English, and French

### 3. Added Live Location Stop Detection
- Modified `handle_location` to detect when a regular location (no `live_period`) is received while user has active session
- This indicates the user has stopped live location sharing
- Bot now properly stops the session and sends confirmation message

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
- Test for session expiration after live_period
- Test for manual stop detection
- Test for normal operation within the period

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/live_location_tracker.py`:
   - Added `session_start` to `LiveLocationData`
   - Modified `_fact_sending_loop` to check session expiration based on start time
   - Added user notification when session expires

2. `src/handlers/location.py`:
   - Added detection for live location stop signal
   - Added localized messages for stop/expiration notifications
   - Removed unused `handle_stop_live_location` function

3. `tests/test_live_location_expiry.py` (new):
   - Comprehensive tests for all expiration scenarios

## User Experience Improvements
- Users now see a clear message when their live location session expires
- Manual stops are properly detected and acknowledged
- Sessions end exactly when they should, preventing unnecessary battery drain and API calls
